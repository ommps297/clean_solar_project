    "# Solar Panels Dust Detection - Clean Training Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a lightweight launcher that runs `train.py` (the real training script).\n",
    "**Why?** The original repository contained ipynb files that were broken due to Git LFS pointers.\n",
    "This package gives you:\n",
    "- `train.py` â€” a clean transfer-learning training script (MobileNetV2)\n",
    "- `requirements.txt`\n",
    "- A small launcher notebook (this file) that runs the training script for convenience\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before you run:**\n",
    "1. Prepare your dataset folder structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "data/\n",
    "  train/\n",
    "    clean/   <-- images of clean panels\n",
    "    dusty/   <-- images of dusty panels\n",
    "  val/    (optional)\n",
    "    clean/\n",
    "    dusty/\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Open Anaconda Prompt, create env and install dependencies:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n solar python=3.9 -y\n",
    "conda activate solar\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Run this notebook cell to start training (or run `python train.py ...` directly).\n",
    "You can pass flags to `train.py` such as --epochs and --batch_size.\n"
